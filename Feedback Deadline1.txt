Mostly correct classification of functional and non-functional requirements. One or two minor omissions. 
You missed or incorrectly classified the following requirements: An employee may be linked to one or more assets.
Fixed department fields [5]: finance, human resources, operations, sales, and information technology. The system must make data acquisition as easy as possible.
Clear instructions must be visible to the user. 
Also beware of adding requirements which are not mentioned in the client brief (e.g. security).
Development approach demonstrates a good grasp of the subject matter. A good approach that follows most parts of an agile development methodology.
I would have like to see more discussion of the distinguishing features of agile methods. Your planned approach should be linked to this, talking more to the management of the project.
You mention good programming practices, but these don't show me that you understand agile methods.
